# Mossimo
Mossimo Simulator Chrome app that makes everything kinda blurry. To install on someone's computer, open up chrome://extensions/ in your browser and click “Developer mode” in the top right. Now click “Load unpacked extension…” and select the directory to which you cloned this repo. You should now see your extension in the list.

To change the amount of blur, open up content.js and change the px on filter: blur(2px) to however much you'd like. Then on chrome://extensions/, click reload extension or hit ctrl+R.
