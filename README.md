# Mossimo
Mossimo Simulator Chrome app that makes everything kinda blurry. To install on someone's computer, open up chrome://extensions/ in your browser and click “Developer mode” in the top right. Now click “Load unpacked extension…” and select the directory. You should now see your extension in the list.

Thanks to robots.thoughtbot.com for the great tutorial!
